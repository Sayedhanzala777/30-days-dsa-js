## 🧠 How to Use This Repo

1. Open any day’s folder (e.g. `/day15/`)
2. Read the `problem.md` to understand the challenge.
3. Try solving it yourself first.
4. Open `solution.js` to compare your logic and learn from it.
5. (Optional) Read `approach.md` to understand reasoning and time complexity.

## 🏗️ Best Practices I Followed

- Used **ES6+ syntax** — `let`, `const`, arrow functions.  
- Added **comments** and **readable variable names**.  
- Tracked **time & space complexity** for most problems.  
- Focused on **clarity > cleverness** — readable, reusable code.  
- Documented progress daily.
