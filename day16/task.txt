Activity 1 : Creating Promises

// Task1> Write a function that returns a promise which resolves after 2 seconds with the message "Promise resolved!".
// Task2> Create a promise that randomly resolves or rejects after 1 second. Log "Success" if it resolves and "Error" if it rejects.

Activity 2 : Consuming Promises

// Task3> Use .then() and .catch() to handle the promise from Task 2.
// Task4> Use .finally() with a promise to log "Execution completed" regardless of success or failure.

Activity 3 : Chaining Promises

// Task5> Create a chain of promises where the first resolves with a number, the second doubles it, and the third squares it. Log the final result.

Activity 4 : Async/Await

// Task6> Rewrite Task 1 using async/await.
// Task7> Write an async function that calls the promise from Task 2 and handles both success and error using try...catch.

Activity 5 : Practical Example

// Task8> Create a fake fetchData() function that returns a promise resolving with ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] after 1 second.
// Task9> Write an async function that uses await fetchData() and logs each fruit.
// Task10> Create two promises (e.g., getUser and getPosts). Use Promise.all to wait for both and log the combined result.
