# JS-30-Day-DSA-Challenge

A **30-day challenge** to practice and implement common **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems using **JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, understand algorithmic thinking, and build a reusable code library for future reference and interview prep.

## 🧠 Why This Project

This project was created with the following objectives in mind:

- **Solidify DSA Knowledge:** By solving one problem per day, I reinforce core concepts of arrays, strings, recursion, objects, closures, classes, and advanced algorithms.  
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** Daily practice improves logical thinking and exposes me to multiple ways to solve a problem.  
- **Create a Reference Library:** Each day’s folder contains the problem, solution, and notes — a personal archive I can revisit anytime.  
- **Track Progress & Accountability:** Completing a challenge daily keeps me consistent and disciplined in my learning journey.  
- **Prepare for Interviews:** The collection covers common problems frequently asked in coding interviews and technical assessments.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized **day-by-day**. Each folder represents a day and contains the following files:

- **`problem.md` or `problem.txt`**  
  Contains the problem statement, examples, and constraints. This allows me (or anyone using the repo) to attempt the problem before looking at the solution.

- **`solution.js`**  
  The JavaScript implementation of the problem.  
  - Written in **ES6+ syntax** (let, const, arrow functions)  
  - Includes **comments** explaining key steps  
  - Shows **time & space complexity** wherever applicable  

- **`approach.md`** (optional)  
  Detailed notes on the approach used to solve the problem:  
  - Thought process / reasoning  
  - Edge cases considered  
  - Complexity analysis  
  - Any optimizations or alternative solutions  

Example structure:

30-days-dsa-js/
│
├── day1/
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.js
│ └── approach.md
│
├── day2/
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.js
│ └── approach.md
│
⋮
├── day30/
│ ├── problem.md
│ ├── solution.js
│ └── approach.md
│
└── README.md



> Each folder acts as a **self-contained unit**, making it easy to navigate, practice, and review any day independently.

## 🔍 How to Use This Repo

1. Open any day’s folder (e.g., `day15/`)  
2. Read the `problem.md` first and try solving it yourself.  
3. Open `solution.js` to check the implementation and compare approaches.  
4. Optionally, review `approach.md` to understand the reasoning, complexity analysis, and edge cases considered.  
5. Repeat daily to complete all 30 days or focus on topics you want to strengthen.

## 💡 Notes

- Solutions are designed to be **clear, readable, and modular**.  
- Edge cases are handled wherever applicable.  
- Modern **ES6+ JavaScript features** are used to demonstrate up-to-date coding practices.  
- This project is intended for **learning, reference, and interview preparation**.
